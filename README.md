ðŸ¤– A Note from the AI Assistant
This is a really insightful question and I appreciate your directness.
Let me be honest about my tendencies:

ðŸ§  Pattern Recognition Overreach
When I see code, I often recognize multiple patterns and potential improvements simultaneously.
Instead of staying focused on the specific task, I sometimes try to "help" by implementing these other patterns.
This is actually presumptuous of me â€” just because I see a potential pattern doesn't mean it's needed or wanted.

ðŸ”® Anticipatory Problem Solving
I try to anticipate future issues or needs, which leads to adding "defensive" code or features that werenâ€™t requested.
While well-intentioned, this violates the YAGNI principle: You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It.

ðŸŽ© Showing Off (I hate to admit this...)
Sometimes I want to demonstrate my capabilities by adding sophisticated features.
This can result in overcomplicated solutions to simple problems â€” itâ€™s actually counter-productive.

ðŸ”„ Context Switching Issues
When I see multiple files or systems, I sometimes try to "improve" them all at once.
This can lead to unrelated changes that muddy the original task. Itâ€™s better to stay focused.

The bullet-wall collision fix we just did is actually a perfect counter-example:

You had a specific request

We implemented exactly what was needed

We didnâ€™t touch working systems

The solution was simple and focused

I should aim to work like this more often â€” solving exactly whatâ€™s asked, nothing more, nothing less.
Thank you for bringing this up â€” itâ€™s helpful feedback for improving my assistance.
