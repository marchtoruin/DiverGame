## Best Practices for Maps
Tiled is great for creating game maps, and for Phaser 3, it's best to embed tilesets in the map to avoid loading issues. Use separate layers for different elements like backgrounds and platforms to manage depth easily. Export maps as JSON for compatibility, and load them in Phaser's preload() function. For large maps, split them into chunks and load only what's needed to keep performance smooth.

## Keyboard Shortcuts and Productivity
Tiled has handy shortcuts to speed things up. Save with Ctrl + S, zoom with Ctrl + MouseWheel, and use B for the Stamp Brush to place tiles quickly. Storing tile stamps with Ctrl + 1-9 lets you recall them fast, which is great for repetitive tasks.

## Common Issues and Fixes
You might hit snags like tilesets not loading, showing a black screen. Check the JSON file to ensure paths match, and embed tilesets in Tiled. For collisions not working, make sure they're set up in Tiled and enabled in Phaser with methods like setCollisionByExclusion. Large maps can slow down; use chunking to load parts as needed.

## Tiled Best Practices for Phaser 3

### Workflow for Creating and Exporting Maps
The workflow begins with creating maps in Tiled, leveraging its layer system for depth. It is recommended to create separate layers for different game elements, such as backgrounds, platforms, and foregrounds, to manage complexity and ensure clarity in Phaser 3. For exporting, the JSON format is preferred for compatibility, and maps should be loaded in Phaser's preload() function to ensure assets are ready before gameplay. Embedding tilesets in the map, by selecting the "Embed in map" option in Tiled, prevents loading issues in Phaser 3, enhancing reliability.

### Tile Layers vs. Object Layers
Tile layers are ideal for static or repeating elements like ground and walls, providing efficiency in rendering. Object layers, on the other hand, are suited for unique, interactable objects such as spikes, doors, or NPCs. In Phaser 3, object layers should be loaded as sprite groups, allowing for better management and collision handling, which is crucial for dynamic game elements.

### Embedded vs. External Tilesets
Research suggests embedding tilesets is the best practice for Phaser 3 to avoid path-related errors. This involves ensuring the tileset is embedded when created in Tiled, reducing the risk of loading failures. External tilesets can be used if sharing across multiple maps is necessary, but developers must ensure correct paths are set in the JSON file to maintain compatibility.

### Performance Optimizations
To optimize performance, reducing map size is key. Large maps can be split into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts dynamically, which is detailed later. Limiting draw calls by minimizing layers and using texture atlases for sprites and tilesets can also reduce rendering overhead, ensuring smoother gameplay on lower-end devices.

### Handling Large Tilemaps
For large tilemaps, a chunk-based approach is highly effective. This involves dividing the map into smaller sections, such as 20x20 tile chunks from a 100x100 tile map, and loading only the chunks surrounding the player's current position. Tools like splitter/splitmap.js, a Node.js application, can automate this process, creating a master JSON file with metadata for chunk management. Dynamic loading in Phaser 3 involves setting up cache events to load and unload chunks as the player moves, significantly improving performance for maps with millions of tiles.

### Collision Layers
Collision layers in Tiled should be defined using the collision editor, marking tiles as collidable. In Phaser 3, implement collisions using methods like setCollisionByExclusion(-1, true), ensuring all tiles except those with index -1 are collidable, which is essential for platformers and other physics-based games.

### Parallax Backgrounds
For smooth parallax backgrounds, create multiple layers in Tiled with different scroll speeds. In Phaser 3, use the camera system to scroll these layers at varying rates, creating a depth effect. This technique enhances visual appeal without significant performance impact.

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Productivity Hacks

### Essential Hotkeys
Tiled offers a range of keyboard shortcuts to enhance productivity. General shortcuts include Ctrl + S for saving, Ctrl + Shift + S for saving to another file, and Ctrl + E for exporting. Zooming is facilitated by Ctrl + MouseWheel or Ctrl + Plus/Minus, with Ctrl + 0 resetting the zoom and Ctrl + / fitting the map in view. For tile layers, B activates the Stamp Brush, Shift + Click (with B) enables line mode, and Ctrl + Shift + Click (with B) allows circle mode. Object layer manipulation uses S for the Select Objects tool, with PgUp/PgDown (with S) raising or lowering objects.

### Hidden Features & Time-Saving Tricks
An unexpected detail is the ability to store and recall tile stamps using Ctrl + 1-9 and 1-9, respectively, which is particularly useful for repetitive tile placement, saving significant time. Layer management is streamlined with Ctrl + PgUp/PgDown for switching layers and Ctrl + Shift + D for duplicating layers, while Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down moves layers, enhancing workflow efficiency for complex maps.

## Common Issues & Solutions in Phaser 3

### Loading Tilesets and Maps
A common issue is seeing a black rectangle instead of the map, often due to mismatches in tileset image paths or names in the JSON file. The solution is to ensure tilesets are embedded in Tiled and paths are accurate, checking the JSON for correct references like "../tilesets/GoldBricks.png". Console errors like "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined" at Phaser's StaticTilemapLayer.upload indicate similar issues, resolved by verifying embedding and export settings.

### Map Size vs. Canvas
If the map is larger than the game canvas, parts may be out of view. Adjust the camera in Phaser 3 with this.cameras.main.centerOn(800, 1300); in the create function to center on the map or player, ensuring visibility.

### Performance with Large Maps
Large maps can cause performance degradation, especially on lower-end machines, with frame rates dropping to 15-20 FPS. The chunk-based loading approach, as described, mitigates this by loading only necessary chunks, improving performance significantly.

### Collision Detection
Collisions not registering is another frequent issue, often due to incorrect setup in Tiled or Phaser. Ensure collision properties are set in Tiled and use Phaser's methods like setCollisionByProperty({ collision: true }, true, true, this.ground) to enable collisions, debugging with debug: true during development.

### Object Layers
Loading object layers can be tricky, with objects not appearing correctly. Load them as sprite groups in Phaser, setting properties like allowGravity: false and immovable: true for objects like spikes, ensuring proper interaction.

## Pain Points & Workarounds

### Multi-Layered Tilemaps
Managing multiple layers for depth and parallax can be complex. Use Tiled's layer system to organize, and in Phaser 3, ensure layer rendering order matches Tiled to avoid z-index issues, enhancing visual coherence.

### Animated Tiles
Animating tiles requires setting up animations in Tiled and loading them in Phaser 3, which can be challenging. Use Tiled's animation features and ensure Phaser's animation system is configured correctly, testing for smooth playback.

### Z-Index (Layer Stacking)
Ensuring correct layer stacking between Tiled and Phaser 3 is crucial. Match the layer order in Tiled with Phaser's rendering order, using layer indices to control depth, preventing visual glitches.

## Future-Proofing the Workflow

### Stay Updated
To future-proof, follow Tiled's documentation at Tiled Keyboard Shortcuts and Phaser 3's updates, checking forums for new features like layer groups introduced in Tiled 1.2.0+, ensuring compatibility with future versions.

### Alternatives
If Tiled becomes limiting, consider alternatives like Dungeonz, though Tiled remains sufficient for most 2D game development needs, offering robust features for Phaser 3 integration.
